# Awesome-Auto-Dark-Light-Mode
For the fanatics who want all bright in day and all dark in night

## Why?

To improve life quality it is recommended to follow the circadian rhythm, aka the biological clock. For this reason people use F.lux, night shift, dark mode etcetra. This repo tries to list all things related to automation efforts in dark/light-mode/night shift etcetra.

## Operating System

### Desktop
I recommend [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) instead of the build-in ones from the OS. In the settings from F.lux you can enable F.lux to set the Dark theme at sunset. Which sets your entire operating system to Dark, and all apps adjusted to this will follow. The build-in ones from OS require location services, which disables your WiFi temporary to check your location and potentially causes hickups in cloud gaming or video conferences[1]. With F.lux you can set your location manually and then disable location services entirely.

### Mobile
Use the build in night shift/dark mode from iOS/Android. Phones have GPS, so the problem that desktops have is not there.

## Wallpaper

### Desktop
Look at the amazing [24 hour wallpapers](https://www.jetsoncreative.com/24hourwallpaper) which are mainly for Mac, but they also offer Windows some wallpapers that work with [WinDynamicDesktop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windynamicdesktop/9nm8n7dq3z5f). With [some work](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/06/macos-mojave-dynamic-background-linux) it should also be possible for Linux. If you have the 24 hour wallpaper on Mac, with some effort (editing JSON) it is possible to convert to Windows/Linux.
